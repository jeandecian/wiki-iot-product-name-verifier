IoT Device Definition:
An Internet of Things (IoT) device is a physical object embedded with sensors, software, network connectivity, or other technologies that allow it to connect to the internet or other communication networks and exchange data or be remotely controlled. This category includes smart home appliances, industrial equipment, medical devices, smartphones, computers, laptops, gaming consoles, and other connected devices. Importantly, it also covers any device that can be compromised, included in botnets, or otherwise exploited by cybercriminals for launching attacks or unauthorized activities. These vulnerabilities make such devices critical points of security concern within IoT ecosystems.
